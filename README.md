# Scooter Link — Android BLE client for Xiaomi Electric Scooters (Mi Home alternative)

**English | [Deutsch](README.de.md)**

**An alternative Android app for the Xiaomi Electric Scooter 5 Pro / 5 Max (the standard 5 should work as well) — dashboard, ride modes, lock, battery and ride data over Bluetooth Low Energy, no Mi Home app needed.**

Looking for the **Elite, 5 Plus or the 6 / 6 Lite / 6 Pro / 6 Max / 6 Ultra**? They have **experimental, read-only** support
only (values are shown, nothing can be changed) — see [Supported models](#supported-models) for the status and how you can help.

---

A standalone Android client with public source code (non-commercial license) for **Xiaomi Electric Scooter** 5-series models
(tested: 5 Pro and 5 Max; the standard 5 should work too) that talks to the vehicle directly over Bluetooth Low Energy —
without the official Mi Home app. The complete BLE auth protocol (ECDH P-256 → HKDF-SHA256 →
AES-CCM) was reverse-engineered from scratch and is verified byte-for-byte against both real
devices.

This is an independent, non-commercial project with no affiliation with Xiaomi.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**Use of this software is entirely at your own risk. The author accepts no liability whatsoever
for damage, injury, fines, warranty loss, account suspension, or any other consequence of any
kind arising from the use, installation, or modification of this software — regardless of
whether such consequences were foreseeable.** This applies to the fullest extent permitted by
law (see also [LICENSE](LICENSE), "No Liability" section, the legally binding version of this
disclaimer).

- **No affiliation with, and no support from, Xiaomi.** This project has no relationship with
  Xiaomi Corporation or its affiliates, and is not authorized, sponsored, or reviewed by Xiaomi.
  All trademarks and product names belong to their respective owners.
- **No server of ours - your data stays on your phone.** The app talks only to the scooter itself
  (Bluetooth, no network involved), to Xiaomi's own cloud API (one-time login only) and to GitHub
  (update check/download only, can be turned off). There is no backend of this project's own, no
  analytics, no tracking of any kind.
- **No warranty, no guarantee of function, safety, or correctness.** The software is provided
  **"as is"**, without any express or implied warranty — neither fitness for a particular purpose
  nor freedom from defects. A protocol reconstructed through reverse engineering may contain
  misinterpretations; incorrect commands could, in the worst case, damage your device, impair
  ride functions, or cause unexpected behavior while riding.
- **Responsibility for road safety and traffic law is entirely yours.** The app shows warnings
  for certain settings (e.g. cruise control, tail light) — this does not replace your own review
  of the rules that apply to light electric vehicles in your country/region. Do not use any
  function while riding in a way that endangers yourself or others, or that violates applicable
  law.
- **For use with your own devices only.** This software is intended for interoperability with
  devices that belong to you (or to someone who has explicitly granted you access, e.g. via the
  export/import feature) — not for someone else's device without the owner's consent.
- **Tested on the Xiaomi Electric Scooter 5 Pro and 5 Max** (BLE chip RTL8762C, firmware
  2.7.0_0015.x). The standard **Electric Scooter 5** (without "Pro"/"Max") **should work as
  well**, but it has not been tested. Other models: see "Supported models" below — **do not use the app with
  a model that is not listed there as tested**, it could show wrong values or change the wrong settings.
- **No speed limiter is bypassed.** This project deliberately implements **no** function to
  change the regional speed limit or to flash the motor-controller firmware — that would require
  physical ST-Link/SWD access to the motor controller and was intentionally not built, regardless
  of use case. Anyone using this code as a starting point for that does so on their own
  responsibility and outside what this project is intended for.
- **Cloud credentials and terms of service.** The cloud-login part talks to undocumented, internal
  Xiaomi cloud APIs. This may violate your Xiaomi account's terms of service; in the worst case it
  could lead to restrictions on your account. Password and device PIN are never hardcoded anywhere
  and are not stored on your device either — they are only needed for the one-time login / key
  retrieval; only the BLE key obtained with them is stored, encrypted via the Android Keystore —
  even so, use of these APIs is at your own responsibility. The same applies to an exported access
  code and export file (export/import feature): they contain the full BLE key for a device (the
  file also documents and history) and should only be shared with people who are actually allowed
  to use that device — preferably with the file encrypted by a password.
- **Personal documents.** The documents feature stores photos/PDFs of your papers (e.g. insurance
  confirmation) in your phone's app-private storage (not in the gallery, unencrypted); the
  original camera photos do stay in your gallery, though. You are responsible for handling this
  personal data. Whether a digital copy is accepted at a check is up to the checking authority —
  this is not legal advice; carry the originals if in doubt.
- **Backup and app lock.** A backup password is optional. If you set one, the backup cannot be restored
  without it — there is no reset. A backup without a password can be opened by anyone who gets the file
  (it contains your scooter keys and documents), so only pass it on to people you trust. The app
  lock protects against casual access to the app's interface, but is no guarantee against targeted attacks
  on the phone.
- **No support, no promise of continued development.** Xiaomi can
  change the protocol at any time via a firmware update and render this software non-functional,
  with no update to this repository to be expected.

## Supported models

| Model | Status |
|---|---|
| Electric Scooter **5 Pro**, **5 Max** | Tested (BLE chip RTL8762C, firmware 2.7.0_0015.x) |
| Electric Scooter **5** (standard) | Should work (same group of models with a private property table), untested |
| Electric Scooter **6 Max** | **Read-only**, experimental: assumed to match the 5 series, not confirmed |
| **Elite, 5 Plus, 6, 6 Lite, 6 Pro, 6 Ultra** | **Experimental, read-only.** Their values are numbered differently, so they have their own tables, built from Xiaomi's public specification and **never tried on a real device**. Values are shown exactly as the scooter sends them (no scaling or conversion, some names raw); nothing can be changed. Other models: only the read-only "Explore values" report |

**Why these restrictions:** the app talks to the scooter through numbered values ("properties"). The numbers
differ between models, and a wrong table would show wrong values or — worse — write to the wrong property. So the
app writes only on models it knows, treats the 6 Max and the models with their own table as read-only and, for models
it does not know at all, only runs the read-only report. If the model is unknown (for example a scooter added from an export code), the first readings are checked
and changes are blocked when they do not fit. **This check cannot recognise every case**: if an unknown scooter
happens to answer plausibly, changes stay possible. Use only the tested models unless you accept that risk.

**Feedback (optional):** if you own an untested or unsupported model, the app can help: in the app settings,
"Explore values (read only)" asks the scooter which values it offers — without writing anything — and creates a
text you can copy; "Copy diagnostics" adds app, phone and scooter model and the latest log. Both leave out serial
numbers, keys and MAC addresses. Posting the text in an issue helps to add your model. There is no obligation, and
no promise of support or of a schedule — this is a hobby project.

## Features

**Riding and overview**

- **Overview** as the start page after connecting: remaining range and battery level in large
  numbers, riding mode (Walk/Drive/Sport) and energy recovery switchable right there, plus riding
  state, trip, ride time, average/top speed, lock, find-my-scooter and fault status — all on one
  screen.
- **Side menu** with the sections Ride, Battery, Settings, Vehicle, Identification, Ride log,
  History, Help and App settings. All known MIoT properties with correct unit/scaling display and plain
  text instead of raw values; most settings are settable, with a safety/legal note for regionally
  sensitive functions (cruise control, tail light). Swipe left/right to move between the scooter's
  sections (not in App settings).
- **Live values**: every value is read at its own pace instead of one long sweep over everything. Ride state, charge and
  riding mode every 2.5 s; odometer and trip values every 2.5 s while riding and every 10 s parked (on the overview
  and ride tab); lock, charging, faults and temperatures every 20 s; settings and battery health once a minute;
  serial numbers and dates once per connection. Opening a tab reads its values at once, and a value you change in the
  app is read back at once. The "refresh while parked" setting (fast/normal/economy) only stretches the values that
  matter little while parked. A scooter that stops answering for 15 s counts as disconnected, so no old values stay
  on screen.
- **Standby**: when the scooter reports its sleep state ("Ruhezustand", shown on the Vehicle tab) its values are frozen
  (e.g. it keeps saying "charging" after the plug is pulled). The app then shows "Standby" instead of every value, only
  "Find scooter" stays usable, and after it wakes up all values (including the once-per-connection ones) are read again.
  Waking the scooter makes it reset its Bluetooth: the connection drops and the app reconnects by itself once (up to
  5 connection attempts of 3 s each).
- **Ride log**: the scooter itself only remembers its last 5 ride-log slots and overwrites the oldest. Each
  time the app reads it, new rides are copied into a ride book on the phone (a short "n new rides imported"
  note shows for 5 seconds), grouped by day with distance, ride time and average speed. Rides that were
  already in the scooter when the ride book started have no date. Exportable as a text file. A ride that has
  already dropped out of the scooter's slots before the app reads it again is lost. The 5 slots used to be
  re-read on a fixed timer, which could catch a still-growing ride mid-ride and log it several times over
  (each snapshot slightly bigger than the last) - fixed: they're now only read right after connecting and
  right when a ride ends. Existing ride books get a one-time automatic cleanup for this on first launch after
  the update, collapsing such fragments back into the one real ride each group of them belongs to.
- **Tire maintenance**: reminder on/off and interval (14–180 days) settable.
- **Home-screen widget** with the last known status (battery, lock, range).
- **Stays connected in the background** (a small ongoing notification, as Android requires for this): the
  connection, live values and ride recording keep running with the app minimized or the screen off. A small,
  **draggable overlay** can then show the range, the trip distance and the battery level on top of any other
  app (e.g. a maps app) - off by default, switch it on in App settings (needs the "display over other apps"
  permission, requested once); tap it to bring the app back, drag it to move it. Everything not needed for
  that (the on-screen dashboard's own tabs, the battery tab's live readings) drops to a slow background pace
  instead of continuing to poll for a screen nobody can see - this fixed a real background battery drain
  (confirmed live: the app being killed for excessive background CPU use).

</p>

**Documents per scooter** (offline, no connection to the scooter needed)

- A "Documents" tile at the top of the device list plus a "📄 N" button on every scooter card.
- **Scan** opens your phone's camera app (choose e.g. its document mode there) and then the photo
  picker; **Photos** takes existing photos; **File** imports a PDF or image. Several selected
  photos become **one** multi-page document, more pages can be added later.
- **Show-it view**: full screen, paging, zoom, screen stays on, full brightness; PDFs page by
  page. Rename and delete with confirmation.

</p>

**Multiple scooters, export and import**

- Any number of scooters side by side: save, rename, forget (with confirmation) — forgetting also
  removes the scooter's documents and history.
- **Export of everything that belongs to a scooter** (key, name/model, documents, history) in one
  file, optionally encrypted with a password of your choice (AES-256). Import recognizes the file
  by itself and asks for the password if needed. The short text code (key only) remains for the
  quick case.
- **Full backup** of all scooters in **one** file (keys, documents, history and app settings;
  optional password, AES-256, and a protected file opens on any phone with the app) under App settings → Backup. Restoring merges; the app settings can be
  deselected while restoring.
- Sign-in directly in the app: cloud login (password **or** QR code via Chrome Custom Tabs — also
  for accounts without a separate Xiaomi password, e.g. Google sign-in), BLE scan without
  knowing the MAC address, automatic retrieval of the BLE key (`ltmk`).

</p>

**App settings** (also reachable without a connected scooter)

- Language (German/English), theme (system/light/dark), automatic brightness via the light sensor
  (experimental), keep screen on, units (metric/imperial), refresh while parked, connect
  automatically to the last used scooter, confirmation before lock/unlock, ride prompt on/off,
  update notice (checks GitHub once a day for a newer version, can be turned off).
- **App lock** (optional, off by default): asks for fingerprint or device PIN when the app starts. It
  only applies at app start — a running app stays unlocked when it goes to the background, and the
  widget is not protected.
- **Insurance plate reminder** (optional, off by default, Germany): notifications one month, one week and on
  the last day before the plate expires at the end of February, with a "New insurance applied for" button
  in the notification (or a checkbox in the documents) to stop them. No connection to the scooter needed.
- **Update button**: when a newer release exists, the notice offers "Download update": the app downloads the APK from
  this project's GitHub release page, checks its checksum and signature and opens the system installer, where you
  confirm. Nothing is ever installed silently. (Google Play Protect may offer to scan a new version once.)
- **Find scooter**: makes the scooter beep and flash. Connecting and this work while the scooter still sends its
  Bluetooth signal, which the 5 Pro does after being switched off. A 5 Max that is unlocked and idle is not
  reachable at all (Xiaomi's manual: an unlocked scooter in standby switches itself off after about 10 minutes);
  locked it stays reachable.
- **Range at your own consumption (live ride log)**: while your phone is connected to the scooter during a ride
  and the app stays open ("Keep screen on" helps), the app records distance and battery percentage used per riding
  mode — without any questions, and without needing the battery's rated capacity or its voltage (which sags under
  load): the percentage the scooter already reports is enough, since the range estimate only ever divides the
  *current* percentage by it. Once a mode has 5 km recorded within the last 300 km (older rides roll out of that
  window, so an ageing battery or worn tyres show up on their own instead of being averaged in forever), the
  overview's headline range card shows this instead of the scooter's own estimate — for whichever riding mode is
  currently active, switching automatically along with it — with the scooter's own value named underneath for
  comparison. **Rides without a connection are not recorded**; if you do not connect during rides, you only ever see
  the scooter's own (firmware) estimate. The switch in the app settings ("Own consumption analysis", on by default)
  decides which of the two is the prominent one: on picks your own once there is enough data, off always shows the
  scooter's estimate and records nothing. The Verlauf (history) tab lists it per mode, shows the recent rides as
  a chart plus one card per ride (time, mode, distance, consumption, ride time, average speed; only for rides
  recorded from v3.5 on, older ones are summed up in one line) and keeps a battery health log (health, cycles,
  odometer) that only gets a new row when health or cycles change; a "Reset history" button there clears all recorded distance/consumption for
  a fresh start after something like a battery replacement — the 300 km window already handles gradual wear on its
  own, this is only for a sudden, one-off change.
- **Copy diagnostics**: one button in the app settings copies app, phone and scooter model, settings and the latest
  error messages (no MAC address, keys or documents) for a bug report.
- **Send documents**: one tap sends a scooter's documents (without the key) to family members. On their phone the
  file is picked with "File" in the documents screen and merged. A backup file can also be read in directly via
  "Add scooter" (new phone, family).
- The back gesture steps outward: close menu → overview → clean disconnect to the device list →
  leave the app. There is also a "Disconnect" button.

</p>

**Under the hood**: persistent BLE session (no reconnect per request). Connecting first waits for
an actual advertisement from the saved scooter before attempting the BLE connection itself — so
switching the scooter on even a second after tapping it still connects, instead of running into a
blind connection timeout that never notices. The device tile shows this live (green, "Looking for
scooter …" → "Connecting …" → "Authenticating …") and turns red with the reason if it ultimately
fails, cleanly separate from a manual disconnect (so returning to the list after cleanly
disconnecting never falsely shows a failure). Some Android BLE stacks can drop a connection
without ever reporting it (confirmed live: the app kept silently re-trying forever, sitting on the
last values it had ever read) - a failed request is now treated as a lost connection right away
instead of waiting out its full timeout, and the app returns to the device list with a clear reason
instead of quietly showing stale data.

## Getting started

1. Download the APK from the [Releases](https://github.com/desperado0044/xiaomi-scooter-link/releases)
   and install it (sideload, allow "unknown sources"; not a Play Store release). Allow the Bluetooth
   permission. From version 2.2 on the APK is signed with a dedicated release key (certificate SHA-256
   see "Building"). **Switching from 2.1 or older:** those versions were debug-signed, so Android will
   not accept the update over the old app — create a backup once in the app settings, uninstall the
   old app, install the new one and restore the backup. Updates work normally after that.
2. "Add scooter": cloud login (QR code or password); if a sharing PIN is set, enter the device PIN
   — the app fetches the key once. Alternatively import an export file or code.
3. Tap the scooter in the device list — the overview opens.
4. Documents: "Documents" tile → Scan, Photos or File.
5. Second phone (e.g. family): on the first phone "Export", share the file, on the second
   "Add scooter" → "Choose file". To share only the documents, use "Send documents" in the documents
   screen instead.
6. New phone: on the old phone create a backup in the app settings (⚙️) under "Backup" (if you set a
   password, remember it) and move the file to the new phone. Install the app there and, already on the empty
   "Add scooter" start screen, choose ⚙️ → Backup → "Restore" — no cloud login needed.

[PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0](LICENSE) — free to use, share, and modify for **any
non-commercial purpose** (personal, research, teaching, hobby). Commercial use, whether as an
open- or closed-source product, is **not** permitted. This is a deliberate choice: nobody should
make money off this work, not me and not anyone else. Because of this restriction the project is

## Acknowledgments / Foundations

This project would not have been possible without the following prior work by others:

- [KuziaMother/SCOOTER_5_PRO](https://github.com/KuziaMother/SCOOTER_5_PRO) — the decisive
  reference for this device's BLE auth protocol (ECDH/HKDF/AES-CCM flow, channel transport, MIoT
  property layer). Its code is **not bundled** here, only independently reimplemented in Kotlin
  and verified against the real devices.
- [PiotrMachowski/Xiaomi-cloud-tokens-extractor](https://github.com/PiotrMachowski/Xiaomi-cloud-tokens-extractor) —
  template for the Mi Cloud login flow (RC4 encryption, signature, `askbluetoothkey`),
  independently ported to Kotlin here.

The full, chronological reverse-engineering process (including dead ends, discarded hypotheses,
and every intermediate step) is documented in [`docs/RESEARCH_LOG.md`](docs/RESEARCH_LOG.md).

## Building

```
cd android-app
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The APK lands under `android-app/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`. Requires the Android SDK,
minSdk 26 (Android 8.0); tested on Android 15/16, plus (BLE connectivity check only) Android 9.

Release builds (`./gradlew assembleRelease`) are signed with a key read from
`~/.scooter-signing/keystore.properties` (`storeFile`, `storePassword`, `keyAlias`, `keyPassword`);
without that file the release APK stays unsigned, debug builds are unaffected. Certificate SHA-256
of the official releases from 2.2 on:
`BE:42:25:12:15:B5:39:17:90:10:D7:7D:9A:FE:DD:52:AD:F9:43:E6:35:27:AC:0F:79:39:B9:D5:6E:13:BC:9F`
